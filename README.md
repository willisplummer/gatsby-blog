# Willis Plummer Personal Blog

My personal blog. Forked from [Dan Abramov's blog](https://github.com/gaearon/overreacted.io).

To run locally, `yarn`, then `yarn dev`, then open https://localhost:8000.

# TODO

- [X] Write first post
- [X] Publish to blog.willisplummer.com via github pages
- [X] Actually perform typechecking
- [X] Fix nightmode (lol)
- [ ] Set up a tag system to sort posts about programming and posts about art or move art posts to elsewhere
- [ ] Add a subscribe to mailing list form
